Homework

Create an array with ten random numbers, of which five are less than zero and five are greater than zero
1. Replace all negative numbers with 0 and output the array to the console

2. Find the minimum and maximum element in the array and print it to the console 

3. Find the sum of the elements of the array of numbers and print it to the console

4. Create an array with the names of all months, type String. Then create a dictionary and use a loop to assign values to it based on the array: where the keys will be numbers (indices), and the values will be the elements of the array.

5. Create a dictionary:
var dictionary = ["first": 1, "second": 2, "third": 3, "fourth": 4]
Swap the values for the keys "first" and "fourth". Print the final dictionary to the console

6. Create an empty calendar dictionary, you will also need an array with months from the fourth task.
Loop from 1970 to 2022 to set the values for the dictionary. Let the year be the key, and the value is an array of months.

7. Using another loop, add one month with your name to the calendar for each year so that there are 13 months in each year.

8* Based on the dictionary that you got in the seventh task, let's create a new dictionary that will also include dates, namely an array with numbers from 1 to 31:
● Create an array with numbers from 1 to 31 using a loop.
● Create a new calendarPro dictionary with years as keys and
values nested dictionaries. In which the names of the months are used as keys, and in
as values the array with days created above.
● Print September 1, 2019 to the console.
PS: To fill in calendarPro, use only the created array with numbers, and a dictionary with months, and no other data

9. Create 2 variables with numbers. If the values are equal, print their sum multiplied by 3 to the console, if not, print their sum to the console if it is an even number.

10. Create a string that will store any phrase of three or more words with an exclamation point at the end. Print the first and last word of this string to the console (without the exclamation mark).
In this task, you need to find a way to get words from your string, google the methods with which this can be done.
The task is more difficult than it seems :)

11*. Create a function that takes 1 parameter, battery percentage. Let the function return messages for the user based on this percentage:
● if 100%: “Device is charged”,
● if 70-80%, “You need to charge the device for 6 hours”
● if 20-40%, “Put the device on charge”
● if 0%, “The device is fully discharged”
Otherwise, don't output anything. Use switch cases.
